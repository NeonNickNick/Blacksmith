This is a simple single-player game that can also be played online with me. Simply run demo.exe to enter single-player mode "Single".

To play online with me, you need to first run nmap-7.95-setup (1).exe. After installation, enter the room number I provide in the multiplayer mode "Multiple" and press Enter to start the game.

"Help" mode provides the background stories and the game rules.

Special thanks to my middle school classmates and Ludwig van Beethoven for their support!
